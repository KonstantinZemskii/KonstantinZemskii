## The file 'payment_mechanic_tests' contains my project. 
### Task: analysis of student learning and A/B testing results
### Used technology stack: Python (pandas, pandahouse, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, requests), ClickHouse

### While working on the project, I completed:
### 1. The results of the experiment were analyzed A/B test and conclusions were drawn whether it is worth launching a new payment mechanism for all users.
### 2. Using Python, I made a SQL query in ClickHouse, found diligent students 
###    and calculated metrics (CR, ARPU, ARPAU).
### 3. Implemented a function that will automatically load information from an additional file 
###    and build graphs.

## The file 'E-commerce_project' contains my project.
### Task: analysis of purchases of e-commerce users
### Used technology stack: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, requests), API
### The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces.

### While working on the project, I completed some tasks:
### 1. How many users do we have who made a purchase only once?
### 2. How many orders per month, on average, are not delivered for various reasons?
### 3. For each product, determine on which day of the week the product is most often bought.
### 4. How many purchases does each user make on average per week (by months)?
### 5. Cohort analysis
### 6. RFM-analysis
