## The file 'first_project_Comerce' contains my study project.
### The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces.

### While working on the project, I completed some tasks:
### 1. How many users do we have who made a purchase only once?
### 2. How many orders per month, on average, are not delivered for various reasons?
### 3. For each product, determine on which day of the week the product is most often bought.
### 4. How many purchases does each user make on average per week (by months)?
### 5. Cohort analysis
### 6. RFM-analysis
