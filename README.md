## The file 'payment_mechanic_tests' contains my project. 
### Task: analysis of student learning and A/B testing results
### Used technology stack: Python (pandas, pandahouse, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, requests), ClickHouse

### While working on the project, I completed:
### 1. The results of the experiment were analyzed and conclusions were drawn whether 
###    it is worth launching a new payment mechanism for all users.
### 2. Using Python, I made a database query in ClickHouse, found diligent students 
###    and calculated metrics (CR, ARPU, ARPAU).
### 3. Implemented a function that will automatically load information from an additional file 
###    and build graphs.
